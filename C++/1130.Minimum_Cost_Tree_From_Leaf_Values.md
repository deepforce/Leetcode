1130. Minimum Cost Tree From Leaf Values

Given an array `arr` of positive integers, consider all binary trees such that:

- Each node has either 0 or 2 children;
- The values of `arr` correspond to the values of each **leaf** in an in-order traversal of the tree. *(Recall that a node is a leaf if and only if it has 0 children.)*
- The value of each non-leaf node is equal to the product of the largest leaf value in its left and right subtree respectively.

Among all possible binary trees considered, return the smallest possible sum of the values of each non-leaf node. It is guaranteed this sum fits into a 32-bit integer.



DP is good but not efficient. 

When we build a node in the tree, we compared the two numbers `a` and `b`.
**In this process,**
**the smaller one is removed and we won't use it anymore,**
**and the bigger one actually stays.**



The problem can translated as following:
Given an array `A`, choose two neighbors in the array `a` and `b`,
we can remove the smaller one `min(a,b)` and the cost is `a * b`.
What is the minimum cost to remove the whole array until only one left?



```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int mctFromLeafValues(vector<int>& arr) {
        int res = 0, n = arr.size();
        vector<int> stack = {INT_MAX};
        for (int a : arr) {
            while (stack.back() <= a) {
                int mid = stack.back();
                stack.pop_back();
                res += mid * min(stack.back(), a);
                cout << res <<endl;
            }
            stack.push_back(a);
        }
        for (int i = 2; i < stack.size(); ++i) {
            res += stack[i] * stack[i - 1];
            cout << res << endl;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
