1227. Airplane Seat Assignment Probability

**Approach 1:  Recursive**

For the `1st` passenger, there are 2 cases that the `nth` passenger could take the right seat:
`1st` passenger

1. Take his own seat, the probability is `1 / n`;
2. Take a seat neither his own nor the one of the `nth` passenger, and the `corresponding` probability is `(n - 2) / n`; In addition, other passengers (except the `nth` one) should not occupy the `nth` seat;
   Now there are `n - 1` passengers and `n - 1` seats remaining, and the `2nd` passenger, like the `1st` one, have `2` options to make it possible the `nth` passenger take the right seat:
   a) take the `1st` passenger's seat, the probability is `1 / (n - 1)`;
   b) Take a seat that is neither the `1st` passenger's nor the `nth` passenger's, and the `corresponding` probability is `((n - 1) - 2) /( n - 1)`;
   Obviouly, we recurse to subproblem of `(n - 1)` .



Combined the above `2` cases, we have the following code:

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    double nthPersonGetsNthSeat(int n) {
       if (n == 1) return 1.0;
       return 1.0 / n + double((n - 2)) / n * nthPersonGetsNthSeat(n - 1);
    }
};
```

**Analysis**
Time: O(n), space: O(1).



**Approach 2: Mathematics**

1. `n = 2`, we have `f(2) = 1/2`; the assumption holds;
2. Suppose `n = k` we have `f(k) = 1/2`, when `n = k + 1`,

```mathematica
f(k + 1) = 1 / (k + 1) + (k + 1 - 2) / (k + 1) * f(k)
         = 2 / (2 * (k + 1)) + (k - 1) / (k + 1) * 1/2
         = 1 / 2
```

That is, `f(k + 1) = 1 / 2` also holds.

From above 1 and 2, we complete the proof.

Therefore, the solution will be:

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    double nthPersonGetsNthSeat(int n) {
       if(n==1) return 1.0;
       return 0.5;
    }
};
```

**Analysis**
Time: O(1), space: O(1).
